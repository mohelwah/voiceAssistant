# Project Type: Langchain Project
# Project Name: Voice Assistant

In this project, I am creating a voice assistant as a Flask App. I am utilizing Langchain to manipulate the LLM OpenAI model, establishing a conversational chain with memory. Additionally, I am integrating the Multilingual v2 model from Eleven Labs to convert messages from the Langchain chain into voice.
